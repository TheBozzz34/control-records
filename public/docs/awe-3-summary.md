# Meteor Hill (AWE-3)

NOTE: Per Archival Mandates 8.A, this document has been edited to meet current administrative standards. Certain terminology may be out of date.

## EVENT SUMMARY:

This Paradimensional Occurrence consisted of three sequential sinkholes induced by subterranean implosions revealing foreign material of magmatic qualities.

## EVENT RESPONSE:

A local chapter of the Youth Science League were participating in an archaeological dig on the hill when the event occurred. Many boys were injured in the resulting collapse. Some touched the magma directly.

Bureau agents arrived at the scene seven days after the incident. Samples of the lava-like material were taken. The area was quickly sealed off from the public at our recommendation. Our aim was to ensure all remnants of the material were rendered inoffensive but the magma descended too deeply into the Earth to retrieve. Foul-smelling odors were detected in the area which were hypothesized being the dissipated element's vapor trail left at the scene.

All acquired material was delivered to Washington for examination in the Bureau's onsite laboratories.
