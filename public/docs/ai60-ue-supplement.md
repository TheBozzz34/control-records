# Victorian Mirror (AI60-UE)

## BACKGROUND:

~~xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx~~. She was admitted to a mental ward for “emotional instability” soon after relocating to Illinois with her family in 1914.

The item only appears on record again in 2006 when the Bureau investigated a sudden rise in disappearances in ~~xxxx xxxxxx~~, Illinois. Agents found the item hanging in the local library. They contained it quickly, though the missing people of the town were never recovered.

## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:

DATE: August 18th, 1915

We certify that the case of Mrs. ~~xxxx xxxxxx~~ has shown her to be a lunatic under the reasons of Hysteria, Bad Company, and Imaginary Female Trouble. Her fixation with the family looking glass is noteworthy, though not an uncommon matter when considering the female disposition.

Mrs. Carver is a fit subject for the lunatic asylum and will remain in its confines until her affliction has passed.

Signed,

Dr. ~~xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx~~
