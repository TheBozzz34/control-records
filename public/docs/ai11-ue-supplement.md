Witnesses described it as “a black sphere with faint light behind it.” It hovered just off the bow of the ship.

Soon after, the vessel lost structural integrity. The ship’s metal rusted and fell apart within minutes. As the ship sank, the sphere lowered into the water. A passing fishing vessel called the ~~xxxxxx xxxxxx~~ rescued the four surviving crew.

Agents were dispatched to the White Ocelot's last known coordinates (~~xxxxxx xxxxxx xxx xxxxxx xxxxxx~~) and began diving operations. On the ocean floor, the agents found the sphere. The ship was entirely destroyed except for its anchor. As agents lifted the anchor off the ocean floor, they noticed the sphere behaved in conjunction with the anchor, moving and stopping as one.

Contact with the sphere was avoided, but handling the anchor proved harmless. The item was transported by the ~~xxxxxx xxxxxx~~ to the US port of ~~xxxxxx xxxxx~~. Upon arriving in New York, it was brought into the Bureau via the ~~xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx~~.
