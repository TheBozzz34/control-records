# Holiday Memories Tree (AI14-AE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

Item must be contained within a soundproof cell.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

A “Holiday Memories” brand white plastic tree with green plastic stand.

The item repeats words and phrases spoken with a range of ~~xxxx~~ feet, always in a tone below ~~xxxxxx~~hz. This verbal mimicry has profoundly distressing effects on the individual it is copying.

## BACKGROUND:

The item was taken from the ~~xxxxxxxxxxxxx~~, a Canadian research station established on Ross Island in Antarctica, where it was used to celebrate the holiday season. In 1979, solar radiation damaged the radio, severing the base’s only means of communication with the world.

After the frozen passages opened, a military expedition visited the base to re-establish contact. They found the base’s occupants in various states of madness, rambling about voices in the tree. Military personnel discovered they also heard the tree speaking. After locking the item in a supply crate, they brought it back to the mainland, at which point the Bureau intervened.
