# Moving Letters (Al77-KE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

Black Rock panelling suppresses the item's effect.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

A stack of four envelopes, each containing a single page of paper. All four letters are illegible due to extreme water damage. The envelopes, curiously, do not show any sign of such damage and are covered in messages of love.

The item(s) are able to move short distances at a pace of less than ~~xxx xxxxxxxx~~ and always in a ~~xxx xxxxxxxx~~ direction. This is the first Altered Item to have multiple separate parts, a fact previously believed to be an impossibility by ~~xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx~~.

A proposal to take the item(s) outside the Oldest House and follow their movement to its final destination is under consideration with the budget committee (see file RTO-7158 for details).

## BACKGROUND:

Item(s) was found in the Dead Letter Archives, where the Heard Archivist found it attempting to escape a filing cabinet. She reports having no record of the item(s) in her archive of letters.
