# Burrough Tractor (AI82-KE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

Item is not in Bureau custody. None known.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

A Frank Elk tractor. Olive green. Dried blood on the grill when last seen.

Item is capable of vocalized responses (or "growls") and unmanned locomotion. Considered highly aggressive and dangerous.

## BACKGROUND:

The item first came to the Bureau's attention after the death of William Burrough, owner of Burrough Farm outside of Trenton, Texas. Local authorities arrived on scene after an empkoyee found the mutilated body of Mr. Burrough beneath his tractor.

Police arrived, but were immediately driven away by the tractor. Panicked calls to federal authorities were intercepted by Bureau communications staff. A team was dispatched.

Upon arrival, the agents approached the item. It responded by "growling like a bear". Three agents were injured when they tried to detain the item, which escaped. Aerial searches for the item are ongoing.

Speaking to Mrs. Burrough only revealed that she had a domestic altercation with Mr. Burrough earlier the night of the incident. Whether these events are connected is currently unknown.
