## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:

[NOTE: Miscommunication led to a local coroner examining the body of William Burrough]

BURROUGH, WILLIAM - Male - Caucasian

CASE SUMMARY: 33-year-old man found dead on his property, per police report. Remains obtained for Coroner's office also include blood, urine, bile, stomach contents, and bone fragments.

AUTOPSY FINDINGS:

Blunt force injuries - head:

a. Lacerations - left ear/cheek

Blunt force injuries - extremities:

a. Dislocation - right knee

b. Complete avulsion of the right upper extremity with associated fracture of the proximal right humerus

Extensive trauma - abdominal region:

a. Complete avulsion of multiple organs, including stomach, heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and portions of the large and small intestine (all missing from scene)

CONCLUSION: It is my opinion that Mr Burrough's death is not the result of a mechanical accident, as claimed by authorities. The removal of organs is consistent with animal attack.
