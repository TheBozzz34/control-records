# “Get Well” Balloon (AI58-KE)

## BACKGROUND:

The item was used in the children’s ward of a local hospital in ~~xxx xxxx xxxx~~. Witnesses do not recall where the balloon came from. Therapy dogs, part of a program called ~~xxx xxxxxxxx xxxx~~ meant to comfort the sick children, were noticeably attracted to the item. They reportedly jumped at the item, licking it when they could.

The children claimed the dogs began walking through the halls of the hospital at night, howling in a low pitch. One child described the sound as “singing”.

A few days later, the dogs were all discovered dead, a dark substance leaking from their ~~xx xxx xxxxxxx~~. The hospital staff called local authorities, who called the CDC. Bureau agents intercepted this call and arrived at the scene within ~~xxxxx~~ hours. The item was taken for evaluation, along with the remains of the dogs (see file PAI-241 1.B for details).
