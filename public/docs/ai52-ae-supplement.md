# Rubber Duck (AI52-AE)

## BACKGROUND:

Discovered in the home of Agent ~~xxxxxxxxxxxx~~ after his young daughter complained of being followed by her rubber duck. According to Agent ~~xxxxxxxxxxxx~~, the matter was ignored, believed to be the result of a child's imagination, until he began to hear the quacking at night.

After discovering the item hiding in his daughterâ€™s closet, he brought it to the Bureau for study.

UPDATE: It was discovered that Agent ~~xxxxxxxxxxxx~~ was bringing known paranatural materials into his home, illegally taking them outside the Oldest House. How this may have affected the creation of an Altered Item is being investigated. Agent ~~xxxxxxxxxxxx~~ has been terminated.
