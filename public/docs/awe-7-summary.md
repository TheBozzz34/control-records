# Fra Mauro (AWE-7)

## EVENT SUMMARY:

A paranatural entity arrived on Earth by infiltrating the Apollo 14 lunar mission at an unknown point of their voyage to the Fra Mauro highlands of the Moon.

## EVENT RESPONSE:

32 hours after the return of the Apollo 14 command module to

Earth, the Bureau was contacted by Mr. ~~xxxxxxxxx~~, a White House senior official, and instructed to send a small team to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

At the base, the team examined the entity and carried out interviews with NASA staff. They learned that four astronauts had returned to Earth instead of the expected three. Each human crewmember was insistent that the mission left with four members, though they couldn't name the fourth when asked. The entity seemingly affected their memory to make its presence feel unremarkable.

The entity was transported to the Oldest House for further investigation.

NOTE: An altercation between NASA security and the investigation team occurred upon their arrival. Mr. ~~xxxxxxxxx~~ called to clarify the matter, though tensions remained high. Bureau jurisdiction and clearance should be defined more clearly with other federal agencies.
