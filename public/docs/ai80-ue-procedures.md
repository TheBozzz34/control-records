# ActionMaxx Camera (AI80-UE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

The item should be isolated from any person or event that is objectively interesting since its effect is activated by the presence of dramatic incidents.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

A movie camera used to make commercial feature films. Internal mechanisms are unremarkable.

Subjects near the item will often experience a “torqued" version of reality resembling the heightened drama and action of a movie. Whether these events are localized alternate realities or products of hallucination is currently unknown.

Additionally, the item seems to record footage from these incidents and creates VHS copies, edited in the style of short films.

## BACKGROUND:

During their investigation, agents learned that a podcast titled “Brian’s Movie Den" had reviewed the item-generated movie “Delivery Disaster". The podcast’s creator, Brian Hennerman, was taken for questioning. The staff of Movie Knight, the store Mr. Hennerman rented the film from, were also questioned to no effect.
