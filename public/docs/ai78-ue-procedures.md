# Eagle Limited Train Car (AI78-UE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

The item's altered effect can be avoided by simply not entering it. Proper signage and barriers should provide sufficient containment.

The item is currently held in the Investigations Sector's AWE West hangar for ongoing investigations.

## DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:

The item's exterior is that of a standard CZ10 Vista Dome train car (the largest known Altered Item on record). Its interior seems to be an adjacent reality related to a trauma or memory belonging to a ~~xxx xxxxxxxxx~~ and not the physical item's own history.

Causation for this link is still to be determined, but possibilities include the outside interference possibly responsible for the item's altered state or trauma imprinting via shared memory states.

## BACKGROUND:

The item was discovered when the Bureau responded to a suspected crime scene in Bloomington, Illinois. The item was identified as an Altered Item and transported to the Bureau for examination and testing. See AWE-44 for further details.
