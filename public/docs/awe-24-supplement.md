# Ordinary (AWE-24)

## DETAILS:

Details are largely based on interviews conducted with Dylan Faden (see interviews ~~xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx~~ and ~~xxxxxxxxx~~ for relevant information) and the obtained therapy sessions of Jesse Faden, as well as circumstantial evidence found at the Ordinary site. Note that accounts provided by all three sources contain conflicting data. Example: D.F. claims there were eight slides for the projector. J.F. mentioned nine slides. The Bureau found one intact slide (designation: 36) and the burnt remains of six others. Unfortunately, these slides are too badly damaged to be used in the Projector.

Jesse Faden is believed to be the individual responsible for burning the slides.

## NOTES:

Dr. Darling has ordered the entirety of the Ordinary town dump be brought to the Bureau for examination and analysis, with the hopes of finding additional slides or other altered materials.

Due to the limited space in the Investigations Sector, this AWE will be investigated in the Containment Sector.
