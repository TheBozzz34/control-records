# Fra Mauro (AWE-7)

## DETAILS:

The Apollo 14 entity (commonly known as "Fra") underwent a series of physical examinations upon its admittance into the Oldest House.

The entity can speak, though its poor grasp of the English language makes any meaningful communication impossible. Interview material can be found at ~~xxxxxxxxxxx~~.

Its physical form consists solely of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuit used by NASA astronauts, the same model worn by the other crew. This could be an authentic EMU taken from one of the NASA astronauts (though this suit does not bear any wearer's name) or one materialized through ~~xxxxxxxxxxx~~ conversion or possibly ~~xxxxxxxxxxx~~ corporealization. The suit itself is slightly damaged, which is likely due to the fact that the command module did not have a fourth seat for the entity to strap into during re-entry.

The EMU is entirely hollow and pieces can be removed, though this seems to agitate the entity. X-rays and spectrograph imaging have shown ~~xxxxxxxxxxx~~-shaped outlines existing within the suit. For safety reasons, the entity will be contained in a secure cell until more information can be gathered.
