# SHÜM Arcade Cabinets (AI40-PE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

A distance of 10 feet between the items suppresses their effect. Effect only triggers on physical contact.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

Items are a pair of arcade game cabinets, originally designed for the games "SHÜM" (A140:A) and "SHÜM 2: Culgar's Revenge" (A140:B). The games were manufactures by Bon-Co Entertainment, now out of business. Despite being a popular arcade game in Japan, during the late 80s/early 90s, no other SHÜM cabinets have been found by our investigators.

When touching one of the items while it stands within 10 feet of its counterpart, the user's mind is transported to a version of their subjective reaity that resembles a video game in logic and function. Events from their everyday lives become game-like sequences in which speed and efficacy are paramount. The brain enters a stroke-like state (as proven by EEG studies on users) which only end after the user "finishes" their game, at which point they resume normal brain and motor function.
