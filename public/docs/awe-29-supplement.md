# Albany (AWE-29)

## DETAILS:

Upon arrival, the squad broke into the warehouse and discovered boxes of undelivered merchandise abandoned by the previous owner of the warehouse. As they investigated the noise, ~~xxxxx xx xxx xxxxxxxxx~~ along the south side of the building caused it to collapse inward. Wooden crates in accelerated physical ~~xxxx xxx xxxxxxxx~~ from ~~xxxx xxxx~~ rendered Field Agent ~~xxxxxx xxxxxx~~ and two of the trainees unconscious. The others escaped the warehouse before it collapsed entirely. In the rubble, they found AI63 at the origin of the  ~~xxxxx xx xxx xxxxxxxxx~~, attracting and repelling debris.

They stood guard around the item until the moon set, at which point the altered effect ceased. They returned the item to the Bureau without further incident. No fatalities occurred.

The collapse of the warehouse was not witnessed by civilians and thus no re-informing by the Communications Department was required.
