# Smoking Pram (AI13-KE)

## SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:

(interview with ~~xxxxx xxxxx~~, conducted with the aid of a French translator on Nov. 17, 2009 in a retirement home in ~~xxxxx xxxxx~~, France)

A: Where were you on August 2, 1979, Mr. Beaulieu?

RB (translated from French): So specific a date! (laughter) As if I could ever forget. I was called to a fire at the Rue ~~xxxxx xxxxx~~.

A: What did you see?

RB: Smoke, white like a new Pope, rising up from the windows of a small shop. I sent my men in. I was fire chief back then.

A: What happened next?

RB: We pulled the shop owner out. He was already dead. Smoke in his lungs. We found the source the source afterwards. A baby's walker. Poured water onto it, but that only encouraged the smoke. We pulled the carriage outside. Smoke kept shooting out! A crowd gathered. People said it was a miracle. But I disagreed. It seemed to me like more of an omen. We brought the strange thing back to the fire hall. Some Americans, like yourself, came later and took it away.
