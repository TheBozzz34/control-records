## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

Item has proven impossible to fully contain when in proximity of human beings.

Item is to be sent to ~~xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxxxx~~ in the ~~xxxxxx xxxxxx~~ of the Oldest House in order to prevent any future access.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

A VHS (Video Home System) tape cassette. Item will not eject from the television player used at the time its altered status became evident.

The VHS plays footage of ~~xxx~~ (Entity A-001) cleaning a floor and dancing. This footage renders individuals incapable of movement, speech, or thought while the television screen is within view. This effect is estimated to last indefinitely, though the most time spent in this state by a test subject is 21 hours. Individuals only recollect hearing strange music during their entranced state. Footage plays on a constant loop even when the television is not connected to a power source.

Even when the television and its footage are contained within an enclosed cell with no window, agents in proximity have been driven to open and enter the cell by the item's entrancing nature.
