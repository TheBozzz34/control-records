## Appendix:

(Text transcribed from the item)

“For ten years I’ve tried to write my escape, only sinking deeper. I used to know where fiction ends and reality begins. Here, they are all the same. It’s a hideous trap, my every thought made real. Fear. Desire. How can I ever know for sure I’ve escaped and not just lost in my own fantasy of it? That thought alone can drive you mad.”

The identifiable words in the scratched-out portion:

“Falls” (Bright Falls?), “haunting”, “Wake” (Alan Wake?), “light switch’, “ocean”, “too late”, and the final sentence “You’ve been warned”.
