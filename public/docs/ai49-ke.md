# Red Light (AI49-KE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

The object's effect is subdued by exposure to sunlight.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

A traffic light with three distinct lights arranged vertically on each of its four sides. From top to bottom, the lights shine red, yellow, and green.

A popular children's game (see CBA-316 for details) is believed to be integral in the manifestation of this item and its effect. If an entity approaches the item while its red light is activated, they will be instantaneously relocated a distance of ~~xxxxxxx xxxxx~~ from the item.

NOTE: Theories that the item is shifting people to a former timeline or parallel universe have been explored and dismissed.

## BACKGROUND:

The item was discovered after a street light at an intersection near the elementary school began shifting people away from itself after sunset. A local panic brought the case to the attention of the Bureau. The item was contained and a gas leak was blamed for this confusion in the townspeople's perception.
