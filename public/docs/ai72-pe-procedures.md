# Wolff Globe (AI72-PE)

## CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:

No unique procedures required. However, contact should be limited, as some report feeling disoriented after touching it.

## DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:

Item is handmade, set in dark wood. The item itself is lacquered, hand-painted, spins freely on all axes. While the continents and oceans are recognizably those of Earth, careful examination has revealed numerous ~~xxxxxx xx xxxxx xxxxxxx xx~~ and other geographic additions that do not exist on our planet. One of these islands has a city marked on it, named “Tan Relio”. There are no signatures left by its maker.

Physical contact renders subjects dizzy and disoriented, with some reporting a feeling of unfamiliarity with their surroundings. This effect seems to grow worse with prolonged contact, culminating in a sense of listlessness and depression. Suicide has been observed in ~~xxxxx~~ handlers.
