It remains to be determined whether the AWE was spontaneous or the direct result of the sabotage.

## EVENT RESPONSE:

The Bureau had been tracking said group at the time and the intel gathered suggested an event of this caliber was imminent in Bloomington. As a result, a response team on site was able to respond to the train accident site within minutes of its occurrence. They arrived to find emergency processes underway, but also equipment left behind by the suspected group. A suspicious onlooker managed to elude agents after they attempted to make contact.
