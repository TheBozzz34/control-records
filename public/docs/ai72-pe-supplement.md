(article from the Toronto Daily)

"So why would a 36-year-old Bay Street investment trader, filthy rich, married to a model, disappear overnight? That's the question that's kept Toronto Daily high society up at night this past week. Police say it's being looked into, some nut job radio show in the States claims he disappeared to join the Illuminati, bit it's this reporter's opinion that Mr. Wolff, bored of his job, sick of his family, left it all behind to retire in some remote beach paradise. Now he's sipping Mai Tais while the world thinks he's dead."
