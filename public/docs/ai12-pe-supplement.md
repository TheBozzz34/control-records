# VHS Cassette Tape (Al12-PE)

## BACKGROUND:

This item's creation is the source of much research and debate.

It was a product of the Bureauâ€™s first attempts to film ~xxx~~ (Entity A-OO1) during Operation Shallow Tide. An agent was able to conceal themselves in an area frequented by Ahti, at which point they began filming. The agent reported that the video camera showed no signs of disturbance during the filming.

Later, when reviewing the footage, the research staff became mesmerized by its altered effect. Measures were taken and altered evaluation began.

Never before have Bureau personnel been so closely involved in the creation of an Altered Item. The experiment was quickly replicated, though not with the same results. The footage was simply useless in every subsequent attempt.

This event spawned a great debate as to whether Altered Items are created by paranatural entities, intentionally or otherwise. Similar experiments were prohibited soon after (see the Ash Act for details), as the creation of altered materials was deemed an action the Bureau should not engage in.
