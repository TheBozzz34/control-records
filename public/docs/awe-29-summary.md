# Albany (AWE-29)

## EVENT SUMMARY:

A response team was dispatched to a possible AWE in progress at ~~xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxx~~, Albany. At the scene, the team encountered and retrieved AI63.

## EVENT RESPONSE:

The Bureau had discovered numerous online message boards regarding loud noises coming from an abandoned shipping warehouse belonging to the ~~xxxxxxxxxxxxxx~~ Corporation. Local law enforcement had discovered numerous bodies in various states of mutilation in the vicinity. This, along with the noises, were considered to be evidence of a “werewolf” due to the fact that they only occurred on the last three full moons.

Field Agent ~~xxxxxxxxxxx~~ accompanied a squad of ranger trainees to the site as a form of field training. The likelihood of a genuine AWE was considered low. Despite this evaluation, the team encountered a highly-volatile Altered Item, which they successfully retrieved.
